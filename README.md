Benchmarks for constant-division problems (not a library! for research only!)

# Prerequistes

- A bash shell and a Linux-like system.
- It helps to have the GCC and clang compilers installed. The scripts that ends with gcc.sh require GCC whereas the scripts that ends with clang.sh require clang.
- Some specific tests require a Linux machine with a working ``perf`` command, but most tests run fine on other operating systems. You can generally install `perf` on Linux with commands such as `sudo apt-get install linux-tools` or `sudo apt-get install linux-perf`.
